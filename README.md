# Saearching for Unbound Triple Supernovae Systems 
1st year project

In this repository you'll find code which calculates the chi2 of a pair of objects and then determines at what time a set of objects will run into each other by numerically evolving the equation of time of interception. Here we have defined a "collision" as the difference between the old time and the new (numerically evolved) being no greater than 10^-4 years. The data used was queried from GAIA.
